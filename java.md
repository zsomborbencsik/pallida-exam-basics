# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:

A function is a piece of code that is called by name.
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object as well.
There are two main defferences:
A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called while a function is explicitly called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Constructor is a special member function which has same name as class name and called whenever the object of that class is created.
